*eProsima Shapes Demo* supports two different TypeSupports:

* Shape.idl which can be found in this folder
* KeylessShapeType.idl specifically included for ROS 2 purposes (current ROS 2 Humble does not support Topic instances).
  This IDL can be found in [ShapesDemo-TypeSupport](https://github.com/eProsima/ShapesDemo-TypeSupport) repository.
