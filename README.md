# eProsima Fast RTPS Shapes Demo

The Shapes Demo is an application that Publishes and Subscribes to shapes of different colors and sizes moving on a board. Each Shape conforms its own topic: Square, Triangle or Circle. A single instance of the Shapes Demo can publish on or subscribe to several topics at a time.

It can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of eProsima Fast RTPS or as an interoperability demonstrator with other implementations of the RTPS protocol.

## Download the sources

To download the sources from the repository, clone it from your terminal.

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eProsima/ShapesDemo

If you have already installed eProsima Fast CDR and eProsima Fast RTPS, you can omit the *--recursive* option.

## Building from sources

You will need Qt5, eProsima Fast CDR and eProsima Fast RTPS to build the Shapes Demo. The default configuration assumes you have eProsima libraries installed in your system: 

#### Linux

    $ mkdir build; cd build;
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

#### Windows

    mkdir build; cd build;
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
    cmake --build .

If you do not have eProsima libraries installed in your system, you can build it as a dependency by specifying 

    $ cmake ../ -DTHIRDPARTY=ON

Note: To build and run the application on Windows, you need to set the *CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH* environmental variable to the Qt folder for the Visual Studio version you are compiling against (C:\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64 for example). You will also need to add the /bin/ folder to the path (C:\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64\bin for example).

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will be greeted by the main window, where you can choose to Publish/Subscribe to shapes and see the current existing shapes on the field.

### Publish

The Publish Window allows you to generate a new Shape and corresponding RTPS Topic on the network.

![Publish Window](/docs/PublisherScreen.png)

There are multiple parameters that the user can define in this menu:

* Shape: Defines the topic where the publication is going to occur. Three different shapes can be published: Square, Circle and Triangle. 
* Color: Defines the color of the Shape. This parameter will be used as key; that is, a way to distinguish between multiple instances of the same shape.
* Size: Allows you to control how big the shape is. The size can vary between 1 and 99.
* Partition: You can select different partitions to differentiate groups of publishers and subscribers. You can select between four partitions (A, B, C and D). Additionally you can select the “*” partition, that will be matched against all other partitions. You should note, however, that using the “wildcard (*)” partition is not the same as not using any partition. A publisher that uses the wildcard partition will not be matched with a subscriber that uses no partitions. 
* Reliable: You can select to disable the Reliable check-box to use a Best-Effort Publisher.
* History and Durability: The History of the Publishers is set to KEEP_LAST by default. You can select the number of samples that the Publisher is going to save. You can also select whether this History is going to be VOLATILE or TRANSIENT_LOCAL. The latter will send the last stored values to subscribers joining after the Publisher has been created. 
* Liveliness: You can select the Liveliness Qos for the Publisher between three different values: AUTOMATIC, MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT and MANUAL_BY_TOPIC. You can also set the Lease Duration for the Publisher.
* Ownership: The Ownership Qos determines whether the instance (color) of the Topic (Shape) is owned by a single Publisher. If the selected ownership is EXCLUSIVE the Publisher will use the Ownership strength value as the strength of its publication. Only the publisher with the highest strength can publish in the same Topic with the same Key. 

### Subscribe

The Subscribe Window allows you to read and represent existing shapes on the network.

![Subscriber Window](/docs/SubscriberScreen.png)

This menu provides the options present in the Publish Windows plus the following additions:

* Time Based Filter: This value can be used to specify the minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the subscriber wants between updates. 
* Content Based Filter: This filter draws a rectangle in the shapes window. Only the instances that are included in this rectangle are accepted. The rest of them are ignored. The user can dynamically resize and move this content filter. 

## Miscellaneous Options and Windows

### Other Options

Under the Options->Preferences tab you will find the following menu:

![Other options](/docs/options.png)

You can modify the following settings:

* Transport: You can select between UDP protocol, TCP Server or TCP Client.
With UDP Protocol the applicacion will work sending multicast packets to communicate with other apps. 
TCP Protocol needs a minimal configuration to create the connection between the machines.
If the applicacion is going to run as a server, it only needs to set the listening port where it is going to accept connections.
If the applicacion is going to run as a client it needs to know the IP address of the server and the port where it is listening for connections.

* Domain ID: You can select different Domain Ids. Shapes Demo instances using different Domain Ids cannot not communicate. To modify the Domain ID the user needs to stop the participant (thus removing all existing Publishers and Subscribers) and start a new one with the new Domain Id.
* Update interval: This value changes the publication period for all the Publishers. 
* Length:  This  scrollbar allows you to change how much the Shape moves between two write calls. 

### Endpoints and Output tab

The bottom section of the main screen shows the following table.

![Endpoints](/docs/endpoints.png)

You can use this table to remove endpoints. To methods are available:

* Right click an endpoint -> Remove
* Select endpoint by left clicking it -> Press delete key on the keyboard

The other available tab in this section shows an output log:
